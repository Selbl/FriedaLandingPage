# Frieda Landing Page

Create a landing page as part of [The Odin's Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum for full-stack development. Made the page in HTML with CSS and used one JS function for an email button.

This landing page has information about one of my cats Frieda who I love very much. There is also a link to a similar page with information on my other cat Floyd who I also adore. Both pages share a CSS stylesheet and contain different sections such as header, footer, call to action, quote and information cards on both of my cats.
